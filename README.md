This repository contains a simple implementation of the Regev LWE Problem Cryptosystem, programmed in Wolfram Mathematica. The current version has comments in Spanish. An English version will be comming out soon!
Also, you may find a Python script. This code will produce samples from the discrete Gaussian distribution, which in short words is a normal distribution defined for a $Z_q$ kind of group. A whole explanation for
this and also the LWE problem is being prepared.
